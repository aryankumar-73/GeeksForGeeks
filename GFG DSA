Geek for Geeks, problem of the day : Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence so that not more than two consecutive posts have the same colors. Since the answer can be large return it modulo 109 + 7.

class Solution
{
    long countWays(int n,int k)
    {
        //code here.if(n == 1)
         if(n == 1)
            return k;
            
        long mod = (long) 1e9 + 7, same = 0, diff = k;
        
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) 
        {
            long prev = same;
            same = diff;
            diff = ((prev + same) * (k - 1)) % mod;
        }
        
        return (same + diff) % mod;
        
    }
}
